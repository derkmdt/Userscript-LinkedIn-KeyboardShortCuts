# Userscript-LinkedIn-KeyboardShortCuts

With this Userscript for TamperMonkey (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) you can use J and K keyboard keys to skip through the LinkedIn feed items. Saves you alot of scrolling. On Facebook and a lot of other sites this behavior is added for feed kind of pages.

## How to add script to Tampermonkey
